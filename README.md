# 🐧 Linux Fundamentals Projects

## 📌 Overview
This repository showcases practical Linux projects designed to demonstrate core system administration skills. Each project focuses on fundamental areas such as user management, system monitoring, and automated backups — essential for Associate System Administrator or DevOps roles.

These projects were built using Bash scripting and tested on Linux-based environments such as Ubuntu and WSL2.

## 🚀 Projects Included

### 1. 👤 [Linux User Management Automation](./linux-user-management)
Automates the creation of multiple Linux users and assigns them to groups using a CSV file. Logs every action for accountability.

### 2. 🖥️ [Linux System Monitoring Script](./linux-system-monitor)
Monitors CPU, memory, disk usage, uptime, and top processes. Generates a clean system report saved in date-stamped logs.

### 3. 💾 [Linux Backup Automation Script](./linux-backup-script)
Creates compressed `.tar.gz` backups of specified directories, saving them with timestamps in a structured folder.

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
- Linux terminal commands and file management
- Bash scripting and process automation
- User/group management (`useradd`, `groupadd`, `chpasswd`)
- System monitoring tools (`top`, `df`, `free`, `ps`, `uptime`)
- Archiving and scheduling with `tar`, `cron`, and logging

## 📚 Purpose
These projects were created to solidify Linux fundamentals and prepare for system administration interviews and internships. They represent hands-on experience in building reliable, reusable, and scalable solutions for real-world Linux environments.
